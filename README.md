# community-group

This group aims to encourage uptake of Web Video Map Tracks (WebVMT) to help establish an online ecosystem of users and developers by providing a forum in which to:

   * identify & refine use cases;
   * ensure that the design is fit for purpose;
   * resolve implementation issues;
   * develop supporting documentation & tools;
   * progress towards standardisation.

Participation is welcomed by anyone providing constructive input regarding these topics within the scope of 'synchronising geolocation with video for the web', and by those with relevant expertise in particular.
